# Self-Assessment. 
  
  1. Functionality: I was able to get my program to encrypt and decrypt. As well as read and write the required files. So i believe i got a 3 in this catagory.
  2. Object Oriented Programming: I wasn't able to get module's or inheritence going on my project. However I took alot of time to makes sure that my program is spread out over specific classes that don't hold to much. I believe i got 3 in this catagory.
  3. Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: Most if not all my lines are indented properly and I tried to use the best iteration for the job whenever possible. I wasn't able to get under 10 lines for every method though. I feel confident in a 3 on this catagory.
  4. Test Driven Development: I made sure to test almost every method exstensively. I also double tested any methods originating from another class. I also achieved 100% test coverage. I believe i got a 3 in this catagory.
  5. Version Control: With 72 commits and 10 branches i strived to really focus on my version control on this one. I tried to make every commit be small incremental changes and have a reasonable comment. I worked to make each branch a deliberate and focused addition of functionality. I really hope to get a 4 in this catagory.
